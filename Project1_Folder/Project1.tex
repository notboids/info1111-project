\section{Level 1: Basic Skills}

\subsection{Developing industry skills}
    \subsubsection{1. Work on yearly projects}
    Every year, start by picking a medium-sized project in a new area of computing, whether thatâ€™s a new language, framework or piece of technology. Over the year, work to complete that project and try to meet your original specifications by the end of the year. This will not only help with learning new skills, but also with project management skills. This is because it will help you set a long term goal and figure out the best way to meet it. Because it goes over a year-long period, it can be said that it would mimic the workflows of building large projects in the workplace.
    \subsubsection{2. Learn new skills every month}
    At the beginning of each month pick a brand new niche in coding. This would be a niche like a new Java framework, or a specific terminal tools/command line tool, or a specific computing concept, like blockchain technology, or encryption. Once you have picked the topic, you must then create three goals. The aim of these goals is not to have you complete three things, but to have three things that you could confidently say you would be able to build. This will help organize the learning process. Then, spend 5-10 hours a week on the skill and see that over the next year, you have learned 12 things.
    \subsubsection{3. Attend tech events and conferences}
    Tech events and conferences are great chances to keep up with the newest and most innovative technology and application. Those events could be an informative source of new knowledge and insights. Through them, you can join workshops, meet and talk to your peers and listen to new update from the industry. If time or money is what prevents you from taking part in such events, some events and conferences are hosted online which is really convenient.
    \subsubsection{4. Focus on practical skills}
    It's easy to feel frustrated when you don't understand the basics of operating systems or networking. Other times, you may be having trouble comprehending trigonometric rules used in game software or big O notation of a specific algorithm. However, rather than continuing to strive to comprehend computers, I feel it is more vital to focus on what we can create and achieve with computer tools as developers. In addition, several handy bundles of code known as API that will automate a tremendous amount of work with few lines of code have been created thanks to many developers around the world. After all, no one in the twenty-first century should be writing code in 0s and 1s.
    \subsubsection{5. Work to enhance problem solving skills}
    Problem resolution is at the heart of programming. I believe that the most difficult obstacle for most programmers is attempting to address larger problems as we begin to work on individual/group projects or industry tasks. As a result, as computer science graduates, we should be constantly working to enhance our ability to break down larger difficulties into smaller components. When we build a software product, we should think like an entrepreneur and a future customer of a service, not an engineer or a designer, because this will improve our ability to understand and discover the right challenges. In addition, I would advise that we try to visualise the situation and brainstorm with new ideas rather than only following the directions and work on to raise our voices.


%\subsection{Skills: Nobody : Computer Science}
 %   This section will be kept blank because our group only has three members.

\subsection{Skills: Isaac Kim : Data Science}
    \subsubsection{1. Statistics}
    Statistics may look to first-year university students like myself to be a series of tedious calculations using fixed formulas. After all, that's what we've been doing in "Statistics" classes since high school. As a result, it's mind-boggling to grasp how statistical analysis and probability have such a profound impact on our daily lives. Statistics are used to forecast weather, restock store shelves, assess the state of the economy, and a variety of other things. Statistics on its own is a powerful tool for getting useful insights, but when combined with computer algorithms, machine learning, or AI, it can investigate a far larger pool of data and provide answers to business, science, and societal concerns that were previously deemed unsolvable.
    \subsubsection{2. Programming Knowldege}
    Data science necessitates a mix of math and programming skills because it sits at the intersection of analytics and engineering. Data scientists will be unable to distinguish themselves from traditional statisticians if they are unable to use programming tools. Real data scientists will use sophisticated languages like Python or R to gain access to a wide range of useful functionality for dealing with Math, Statistics, and Scientific operations. Data scientists can utilise computer programmes to apply statistical expertise in a quick and secure manner, allowing them to uncover patterns in large amounts of disorganised data and make use of them.
    \subsubsection{3. Data Wrangling}
    Data wrangling is the process of organising and transforming new data into the appropriate format for later analysis. It's a crucial step that's well worth the investment because it helps analysts make better data-driven judgments in less time. Outlier treatment, missing value imputation, scaling, and correcting data types can help make a data collection more orderly and aid in the development of more accurate statistical results. Data wrangling, in my opinion, is just as significant as Oxford Dictionary's decision to structure its print dictionary alphabetically. It couldn't be worse if an English learner had to go through 1000 pages of paper simply to discover a definition of one word. 
    \subsubsection{4. Data Visualisation}
    It might be difficult to grasp what a data collection has to offer as a story when looking at a series of statistics or numerical summaries. This is where Data Visualization, the more entertaining side of data science, may be able to assist with the solution. Data visualisation enables data scientists to convey complex data sets to scholars and the general public in a more appealing and intelligible manner. Furthermore, because computer software can automate the process, creating complex histograms or pie charts takes only a few seconds and does not require the assistance of a skilled artist.
    \subsubsection{5. Machine Learning}
    Machine learning allows data scientists to easily uncover patterns in a variety of data sources and make continuous improvements to their models without the need for human involvement. Google and Facebook, for example, may develop highly targeted ad recommendation algorithms as more data from various people accumulates. Similarly, a skilled analyst could use data gathered by a Google search to find and predict popular software skills. On a larger scale, reliable prediction models, such as today's weather forecast system, can be constructed.
    \subsubsection{6. Deep learning}
    Deep learning is a step forwards in machine learning because it uses a revolutionary method to decision-making based on a learning model that analyses data with a logical structure in much the same way that a human would. Deep learning applications use a layered framework of algorithms known as an artificial neural network to do this analysis. Using this new, sophisticated technique, data scientists may construct software for self-driving cars that can distinguish between traffic signs, detect pedestrians, and identify automobiles. Deep learning can also be used to anticipate protein structures, create architectural plans, and design semiconductors. I am convinced that it has limitless potential for use in a variety of industries in the future.
    \subsubsection{7. Big Data Anaylsis}
    We produce 2.5 quintillions of data each day! The growth of the internet, social media networks, and the internet of things (IoT) has resulted in a rapid increase in the amount of data we generate. Volume, velocity, and veracity are all high in this data. If businesses do not properly analyse their acquired data in this data-rich environment, they will miss out on chances for wiser business decisions, more effective operations, bigger profitability, and happier consumers. This is why data analysts are so important in today's enterprises: they help organisations minimise expenses, make quicker, more rational choices, and catch client demand at the appropriate moment to generate niche goods.
    \subsubsection{8. Story-telling Skill}
    If it weren't for storytelling and visualisation, all of the data analysis and insights we create as data scientists would be pointless. Putting numbers and facts from your analysis on the table seldom gets you far. Imagine a weather forecaster walking in to tell people about an approaching blizzard. Their warning won't have any impact on the audience if they don't use appropriate visuals and storytelling techniques. Hence, forecasters use graphics and interactive methods to keep viewers hooked and informed. 
    \subsubsection{Teamwork}
    I believe that the most significant element of data scientists is their ability to work in groups. Because data science is such a diverse area, it necessitates collaboration among specialists from other professions. We can't be specialists in all of the subjects and abilities listed above as individuals. It is vital to concentrate on a few abilities in which we are interested and confident while also learning from our team to improve other skills.

\section{Level 2: Basic Technology}

Level 2 focuses on initial evaluation of the tech stack that is used by a selected company. All companies make use of a range of technologies, and these technologies need to work together. A tech stack is basically just this collection of technologies that collectively enable a company's systems. As an example, one of the most common technology stacks for supporting web servers is LAMP: Linux as the underlying operating system; Apache as a web server; MySQL as the supporting database; and Perl (or more recently PHP or Python) as the programming language.

Each student should choose a different tech stack and explain the role of each of the different technologies in that stack. Note that prior to researching your proposed tech stack and spending time writing about it, it might be a good idea to check with your tutor as to whether your chosen stack is suitable. (Target = $\sim$200-400 words per student).
