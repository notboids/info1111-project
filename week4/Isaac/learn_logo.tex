Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.

\section{Why learn PyGame?}
I think Pygame is a great tool for beginners like myself to get comfortable with more advanced 
features of a programming language and usage of many modules/tools of python. Meanwhile, it also 
introduces the process of game development, an area I'm particularly interested in the field of computer science.
